            I have done data visualization research on 
            this topic before, and I believe that the 
            excessive consumption of environmental 
            resources by cash crops needs to be 
            understood by consumers, so I collected data 
            on this phenomenon through various ways. I 
            hope to show this phenomenon through data 
            visual modeling and data comparison. I used 
            some technical skills and some visualization 
            websites to show the visual model.

           <h1>Introduction</h1>
           <p>
                As we all know, agriculture is one of the 
                largest and most important economic 
                activities of human beings. The emergence 
                of various agriculture is the reason for the 
                rise and development of human society. 
                Based on the uses of agricultural products, 
                we can divide agriculture into economic 
                agriculture and self-sustaining agriculture. In 
                modern society, people's pursuit of food is 
                not only satisfied with satiety, but also the 
                pursuit of taste, novelty and health. As a 
                result, the planting of economic crops began 
                to expand wildly, and the ecological 
                destruction and ecological resource 
                consumption of many economic crops in the 
                planting process is amazing.
